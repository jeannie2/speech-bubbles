- bubbles, text still appears and disappears in like batches
- empty bubble - when type out transcript and there is a space. or is also when speaking?
- why listening logs twice? 
- not sure when exactly "listening" logs in console.log
- console.log
- responsive
- location of bubbles + bubble size. top location not consistent when shrink window -> so used bottomSpace instead of topspace
- accumulation with visiblity. words spoken later on have longer hiddenDelay. won't reset to 0 when detect new transcript/speak again... is it getting longer/less immediate the more I speak?
- click listen button twice -> made so doesnt restart listening (guess timing is as if never clicked listen button again)
- long text sometmes extends beyond bubble - will leave
- bubbles, text sometimes out of window when randomlocation on full screen - will leave 
- some font error? made stop, sometimes continued 
- guess transcriptnospaces or whatever it is clears on its own
- text not perfectly centered horizontally and vertically in bubble - will leave
- black color text allowed
- google fonts: allows more funny fonts, abnormally sized ones too, more normal/boring fonts
- google fonts: sometimes error getting font
- may list some words inacurately, punctuation
- ideally append and remove child to save memory 
- z-index - guess no need worry about. guess all ellipses having -1 zindex, with later spoken ellipse and text going in front
- clientheight + 1 is default? https://stackoverflow.com/a/118251/10436361

wishlist:
-grammar and custom styles, black and white bubbles comic book style 
-loudness dependent
-animation
-multiple lines of text in bubble/plain text
-other languages 
-bubbles with plain background
